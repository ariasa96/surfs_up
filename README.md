## Overview of the analysis:
After discovering his passion for surfing, W.Avy decides to open a surf shop in the beautiful island of Oahu. But before investing, he wants to ensure he is well informed of all the climate changes in the island to secure a successful business. He realizes that temperature changes can either make or break his business, therefore he wants to be well prepared for all that is to come. Knowing the temperature year round will help him sustain his busniess.

## Results
After comparing temperatures in June and December, we learn that 
- Both months had similarities and that during both months weather can be extremeky unpredictable. 
- Looking at June dataframe table below, we see a max temperature of 85 degrees and a min tempreaure of 64 degrees. Both temperatures make a grand difference in the productivity of the shop. It can be expected to have great business when the weather reaches 85. However, not the same can be expected if the weather drops to 64 degrees. Therefore, in June, W.Amy can expect to have fluctuating business success. 
- Similarity, December shows a max weather of 83 degrees and min weather of 56 degrees. While December does fall far below June's lowest month, its higher weather days can make up forthe slower business days. During both months, W.Amy will have good days and bad days with his surf shop.

## Summary
My advice to W.Amy if they decide to move forward with the business would be to be patient and not give up. Lie all starter business, it may start off rocky, asnd with Hawaii's unexpected weather, not all days will be good. He will have some days that the weather will permit for great business. But other dsys, may just be too cold to surf and have ice and that is okay. Personally, I feel being well prepared for all weather at any given time would be beneficial to W.Amy being as though the nature of their business success is extremely dependent on the weather. I would collect temperatue data of the past year for each month to really have a year round insight of what to expect. Once they gather this information, perhaps putting it into a graph can help as a great, quick visualization.
